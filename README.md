## Project Description 
**A brief description of the project/challange, what it does, and how it works**\
The Layout Planner App helps users to hang easily a picture on a wall without using any measurement tools. 
Existing Apps only provide illustration of how the picture will be appeared on the wall while the Layout Planner provides the user voice guidance (by Text to speech) and text guidance of how and where to hang the picture in wall according to the user preference and symmetrically to the wall.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- camera (internal or external, now the project work on external camera nut you can change to work with the computer camera by replace)
- rectangular and smooth wall (its not prommised the app will work on other walls)  
- rectangular picture
- internet connection
- speakers (to hear the voice guidence)

### Installing

## Testing
**Explaination how to run tests for this project**\
we put the camera in distance of 3 and 2 meters from the wall, for each distance in angle of 90 degrees from the wall, 66 degreees an 45 degrees from the wall. we tested 3 times for each combination (distance and angle)

### Sample Tests
